    <p>I am currently an Early Childhood/Special Education major
    but I am thinking of changing it because I don't enjoy teaching as 
    much as I wished I would. I am not sure what career path to go down. 
    I am testing some different classes out this semester that interest me.</p>
    <p>I love to read romance books in my free time 
    and spend time with family and friends. My husband and I got married last April 
    and we don't plan to have kids quite yet. We got to get through school first.</p>
    <p>My job at the moment is to donate plasma and I'm still looking for a job to have a steadier income.</p>
    <p>The thing I love most about BYUI is that it's focused on the Savior and that 
    there are a lot of opportunities to learn something different.</p>
    <p>I wanted to pursue web design because it sounded interesting. I also 
    thought about switching my major to web design. It seems like a valuable skill to know.</p>
    <p>I am a third generation member of the church on both sides of my family. 
    My favorite quote is from Elder Holland. He says:"Keep trying. Keep trusting. 
    Keep believing. Keep growing. Heaven will be cheering you on today, tomorrow, and forever.‚Äù</p>
    <p>My favorite Scripture is 2Nephi 2:22</p>
